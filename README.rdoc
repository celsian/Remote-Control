== Remote-Control

This app is designed to interact with a Raspberry Pi's GPIO ports which control a relay connected to a Garage Door Remote for the purpose of Garage Door Garage Light and Electronic Gate control.

Some thing you may want to know:
* There is a required file which is not included in /lib/ called gpio.rb. This file accepts GPIO values and will switch them on for one second at a time. This file should be recreated with your specific task in mind.
* You are expected to add GPIO's with name and pin number directly to the Database.
